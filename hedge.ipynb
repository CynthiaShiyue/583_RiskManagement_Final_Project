It includes the date the hedge was executed, whether the option was used to hedge delta or gamma risk, the type of option (call or put), the strike price, and key option characteristics like delta, gamma, mid-market price, and bid-ask spread. The final column, \"contracts_needed,\" tells you how many contracts of that specific option are required to neutralize either the delta or gamma risk of the portfolio for that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Multiple rows on the same date mean that several candidate options were initially considered—usually the top five—for better precision and flexibility in constructing the hedge. To pick the best one, we created a simple scoring method: we divided the number of contracts needed by the option’s bid-ask spread. This gave us a “hedge score” that penalizes options requiring a lot of contracts or having a large spread (which can lead to high slippage). The lower the score, the cheaper and more efficient the hedge.\n",

    "> We explored other methods too, like selecting the option with the smallest spread or the one with the highest gamma exposure. But ultimately, we went with the hedge score method because it struck a balance between minimizing cost and reducing execution risk. Only the best-scoring option for each hedge type (delta and gamma) was kept in the final output.\n"
